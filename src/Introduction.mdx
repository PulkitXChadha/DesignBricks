# DesignBricks Design System

Welcome to **DesignBricks**, the official Databricks Design System built with React. This comprehensive component library provides consistent, accessible, and performant UI components for building data-driven applications.

## üéØ Mission

To provide a unified design language that reflects Databricks' focus on data intelligence, collaboration, and technical excellence while maintaining consistency across all product touchpoints.

## üé® Design Principles

### 1. Rational
Every design decision has a clear purpose and is backed by user research and data.

### 2. Human
We prioritize user needs and create intuitive interactions that feel natural.

### 3. Data-Focused
Components are optimized for data visualization and analysis workflows.

### 4. Performant
Fast loading and responsive, especially when dealing with large datasets.

### 5. Collaborative
Support team-based workflows and sharing capabilities.

## üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
npm install designbricks
```

```jsx
import { Button, Card, Typography } from 'designbricks';

function App() {
  return (
    <Card variant="elevated">
      <Typography variant="h3">Welcome to DesignBricks</Typography>
      <Button variant="primary">Get Started</Button>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

## üìö Component Categories

### Foundation
Core building blocks like buttons and typography that form the basis of all interfaces.

### Inputs
Form controls and input components for collecting user data.

### Feedback
Components that provide feedback to users about system states and actions.

### Data Display
Components optimized for presenting data and information.

### Navigation
Components that help users navigate through the application.

## üé® Design Tokens

Our design system is built on a foundation of design tokens that ensure consistency:

### Colors
- **Primary**: `#2272B4` - Databricks signature blue
- **Neutral**: Grayscale palette for text and backgrounds
- **Semantic**: Success, warning, error, and info colors

### Typography
- **Font Stack**: System fonts optimized for each platform
- **Scale**: Consistent sizing from 11px to 28px
- **Weights**: 400 (regular), 500 (medium), 600 (semibold), 700 (bold)

### Spacing
- **Base Unit**: 4px
- **Scale**: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64px

## ‚ôø Accessibility

All components are built with accessibility as a priority:
- **WCAG 2.1 AA** compliant
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader optimized
- Focus indicators
- ARIA attributes
